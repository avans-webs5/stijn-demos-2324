# Mongo vs MySQL

- MongoDB is faster with reading/storing*
- MongoDB supports two types of database scaling methods: Replication and Sharding.

| # | MongoDB | MySQL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speed | Unstructured data | Structured data |
| Scaling | Replication and Sharding**. | vertical scalability or read replicas. |
| Security | Encrypting | ACLS |


*Only if you read/store raw data
** A document's shard key value determines its distribution across the shards.

# CommonJS vs ESModules

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/modules-in-javascript/

```js
//old - don't use anymore
({ mod1Function, mod1Function2 } = require('./mod1.js'))

//better!
import { mod1Function } from './mod1.js'

# Micro Services vs Monolith 

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shift-back-monolithic-architecture-why-some-big-making-boudy-de-geer/

> "Improved Performance: Tightly coupled components in monolithic applications can result in **lower latency** and better performance than microservices-based applications, as there is no need for communication between separate services."

> "Running multiple independent microservices can lead to increased infrastructure **costs << $$$$$$$.**"

> "Scalability - The build times and deployment times are more. It becomes difficult to deploy simple features or bug fixes. As a result, fast growing organizations canâ€™t scale with this type of architecture."
